# species_barcoding

This repository is a supplemental resource to a publication entitled **Decoding the Amazon: In situ DNA barcoding of vertebrate and plant taxa of the Peruvian Amazon**

Sections of the data processing pipleine include:

- Basecalling raw nanopore sequence data
- QC and filtering of data
- Demultiplexing sequences into sample folders
- Generating consensus sequence for each sample (collapse many reads into a few representative sequences, trimer primer regions, and polishing contigs)
- Merging consesnsus contigs with metadata and outputting in a data table and fasta format

Annotated code snippets are forthcoming.
